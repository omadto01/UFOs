# UFOs
Module 11

**Overview of Project:** The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by creating a webpage for users visiting the website. The website we created have some features such as dynamic table, filter and filtering table by City,State, Country and Shape. 

**Results:** Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The Search criteria in the beginning was only by Date. We expanded and added four more Search criteria which are by City, State, Country and Shape. See below.

By having a total of five search criteria, the users will have a more option to search for specific criteria eg. "City" the output will search all the UFO sighting only by City and same applies if you search for other criteria.

**Summary:** In summary the webpage with added four search criteria/filter such as Date, City, State, Country and Shape has given the user/visitor's a website to narrow down the search. However, the new design did not add the filter button and having multiple search filter tab can be confusing to user.

The two recommendations I would suggest is to build only one search filter that search based on keywords that allows to search the 5 criteria (eg, State, City, Shape) with added filter button.
